I've been thinking about the gun problem in the United States. I wanted to see if I could apply some NCRP skills to figure out
a way to grow the pie instead of thinking distributively. As far as I can tell:

1. There exists a set of US citizens that absolutely love owning guns.
2. These citizens want to be able to defend themselves.
3. These citizens want to be able to hunt.

However, there exists a chilling amount of gun violence in the United States. It feels like before we've had time to process a
mass murder, the next one is lighting up our screens and buzzing on our phones. It's numbing and horrifying. As far as I can tell:

1. Guns are used to shoot people and murder them.
2. There exists a set of US citizens that want to stop the destructive potential of guns in the US.
3. The desire to decrease the probability and prevalence of gun deaths manifests as a desire to limit access to guns.

# Goal

We should cut gun deaths to 10% of what they are now.

# Problem

There exists a significant amount of destructive potential in the United States in the from of firearms.

# Diagnosis

There exists a lot of guns in circulation
A significant number of these guns are owned by law abiding citizens
A gun owned by a law abiding citizen is minimal risk
A gun owned by someone else is high risk
A gun is dangerous when it is loaded and has ammunition

# Solution

Let's stop focusing on gun control. Let's focus on ammunition control. Let's limit the opportunity for non-law abiding citizens to
stockpile weapons AND ammuniation

# Plan

As of November 2018, ownership of bullets will become a protected right. Law abiding citizens will be allocated 50 bullets of each
caliber for which they own a gun. These bullets will be provided free of charge by the ATF. Citizens will have the right to have at 
most 150 bullets checked out at any time. Most gun owners will agree that 150 bullets provides enough ammunition for self defense
and hunting. This greatly limits the destructive potential of a gun owner. A malevolent character with 150 bullets can still do 
significant damage, but much much less than shooters with massive ammunition stockpiles.

Bullets will be recycled and replenished by the ATF free of charge. Bullets will become every American's right. They will however
be a controlled and tracked asset. e
